# CM-Runtime-Level-Editor

I wanted to learn to make a runtime level editor a long time ago but i couldn't find a single good tutorial.
After searching in google for a long time i found some assets which could be used to make a runtime level editor.
so i downloaded them and mix them. Then i had to modify those codes for a long time according my needs. Finally I managed to finish it. Here it is

This asset is not perfect. This is just a sample version or u can say the core of a simple runtime level editor.
You can modify this asset according to your needs without worrying about the core elements of a runtime level editor.
It has all core elements a runtime level editor has.
#BTW I made the level editor like Unity. If you don't like it then you can modify it according to your wish

#Untimate Note
If u manage to make it improve then do share it with me. I would love to see it and use it
